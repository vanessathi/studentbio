      <p>I'm a student at University of Denver's Coding Bootcamp. <br> 
        My goals are to graduate from the program with a portfolio filled with great content and then find a job that aligns with my skill set! </p>
      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p> I was born and raised in Wichita, Kansas. At the age of 24, I moved to Nederland, Colorado. Since then I have lived in Boulder and currently reside in Broomfield, CO. I would love to find a remote job and explore the Pacific Northwest and the East coast for the next few years before settling my roots. <br> 
    </p>
    <h4>Hobbies </h4>
    <p> Sleeping, reading, painting, and playing the ukelele.</p>
